Its analysis goal is to predict or describe the **churn rate** i.e. the rate at which customer leave or cease the subscription to a service. Its value lies in the fact that engaging new customers is often more costly than retaining existing ones. For that reason subscription business-based companies usually have proactive policies towards customer retention.\n","\n","In this case study, we aim at building a machine learning based model for customer churn prediction on data from a Telecom company.

Remember that this was done splitting the data set in training, validation and test sets. Because this splitting process has a randomness involved the resulting performance metric is also a random varible and the instantaneous value of the variable is heavily affected by the split. It can be the case that the split is very favorable and we get awesome performance metric values, or the other way around. We suggested the posibility of doing this same proces many times to get a good picture of the real behavior of the classifier. This is a perfectly correct way for assessing the performance. However one could argue that some points can be never chosen for testing, or that some points can be shared accross the different training splits. These could bias the result.\n","\n","Another well founded approach in order to circumvent the former problem is what we call **cross-validation**. The idea behind this process is that each point will be used for testing purposes. The most well known cross-validation techniques are:\n","\n","+ **Leave one out (LOO)**: Leave one out is as follows,\n","    + Take one sample of the data set $x_i$.\n","    + Train the classfier with all the data set except for the data selected $X_{train} = \\{X\\}\\setminus x_i$.\n","    + Test the classifier on $x_i$ and store the result.\n","    + Repeat the process for all samples of the data set.\n","    + At the end of the process you should have an array with all the results ready for the computation of a performance metric.\n","    \n","Leave-one-out is computationally intensive, because it requires training a classifier as many times as examples in the data set we have. In order to alleviate this computational burden we can define the following process (leaving out, instead of one data point, a bunch of them)\n","\n","+ **K-fold cross-validation**: \n","\n","    + Split the data set in K disjoint subsets with the same cardinality, i.e. $\\{X\\} = S_1 \\cup S_2 \\dots \\cup S_k$ where $S_i \\subset \\{X\\}$, $S_i \\cap S_j = \\emptyset,  i\\neq j$, and $|S_i|\\approx |S_j|,  \\forall i, j$.\n","    + Select one of the subsets $S_i$. This will be used as test set.\n","    + Train the classfier in all except that subset, i.e. $X_{train} = \\{X\\} \\setminus S_i$.\n","    + Test the trained classifier with $S_i$ and store the individual results for each sample in the subset (we can also consider the partial performance statistics in the subset for other hint on performance)\n","    + Repeat for each subset\n","    + At the end of the process you should have an array with all individual results ready for the computation of a performance metric. \n","    \n","This second approach is subject to some variability in the splitting process. Thus the resulting performance metric is again a random variable. One can repeat this process several times to estimate statistics such as the mean and variance of the classifier. Sometimes you will see partial performance statistics of each fold aggregated as simple way for approximating the process statistics.\n","\n","Leave one out can be seen as a particular instance of K-fold cross validation with K equal to the cardinality of the data set.\n","\n","\n","If we want to do the same thing with the test dataset, in order to minimize variability, we can do nested cross validation. Meaning we can apply a K-fold cross-validation on the test set, and for each one of the K cases, we'll do a K-fold cross-validation on the validation set.

term describes the condition of the data where the ratio between the sizes of the positive and negative is a small value. In those scenarios, always predicting the majority class usually yields good accuracy performance, though it is ill informative. This kind of problems is very common when we want to model unusual events such as rare diseases, the occurrence of a failure in machinery, credit card fraud operations, etc. In those scenarios gathering data from usual events is very easy but collecting data from unusual events is difficult and results in a comparatively small size data set. In order to measure the performance on those data sets one has to use other performance metrics, such as specificity or positive predictive value on the minority class. In the end, the value of a misclassification of a sample depends on the application and the user. For example, in cancer detection because the cost of missing one patient in a trial is very large, we want the predictor to have very large sensitivity (we do not accept false negatives) though it means accepting more false positives. These false positives can be discarded in subsequent tests. \n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sX53kEnAlUfu"},"source":["### 2.1 The confusion matrix\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YvrkUerxlUfu"},"source":["Although accuracy is the most normal metric for evaluating classifiers, there are cases when the business value of correctly predicting elements from one class is different from the value for the prediction of elements of another class.
